This is Jandom, an abstract interpretation based static analyzer 
written in Scala. To try it, you need:

* sbt (Scala Build Tools) 0.11.3 or later [http://www.scala-sbt.org/]
* PPL 1.1.pre2 or later [http://bugseng.com/products/ppl/download/ftp/snapshots/]

The configuration assume you have PPL in the directory /usr/local/lib/ppl.
If this is not the case, please change the relevant lines in config.sbt.

In the main directoy of Jandom, execute "sbt run" compile and execute Jandom. If
asked about the program to run, choose "JandomGUI". It is possible to generate
an Eclipse project with the command "sbt eclipse". The Eclipse project
must be modified to include the native libraries of PPL (in the future, this 
setting will be carried on by SBT).
