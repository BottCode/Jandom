This is Jandom, an abstract interpretation based static analyzer 
written in Scala. To try it, you need:

* sbt (Scala Build Tools) 0.11.3 or later [http://www.scala-sbt.org/]
* PPL 1.1.pre2 or later [http://bugseng.com/products/ppl/download/ftp/snapshots/]
* Soot 2.5.0 or later [http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/] 

The configuration assume you have installed PPL in the directory /usr/local/lib/ppl
and you have the file soot.jar in /usr/local/lib. If this is not the case, please 
change the relevant lines in core/build.sbt.

In the main directoy of Jandom, execute "sbt run" compile and execute Jandom. If
asked about the program to run, choose "JandomGUI". It is possible to generate
an Eclipse project with the command "sbt eclipse".
