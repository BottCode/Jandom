This is Jandom, an abstract interpretation based static analyzer 
written in Scala. To compile it, you need:

* sbt (Scala Build Tools) 0.11.3 or later [http://www.scala-sbt.org/]
* PPL 1.1.pre2 or later [http://bugseng.com/products/ppl/download/ftp/snapshots/]

The configuration assumes you have PPL installed in the directory /usr/local/lib/ppl. If this is not the case, please change the relevant lines in build.sbt, core/build.sbt and extended/build.sbt.

In the main directoy of Jandom, execute "sbt run" compile and execute Jandom. If asked about the program to run, choose "JandomGUI". It is possible to generate an Eclipse project with the command "sbt eclipse".
