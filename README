This is Jandom, an abstract interpretation based static analyzer 
written in Scala. To try it, you need:

* sbt (Scala Build Tools) 0.11.3 or later
* PPL 1.1.pre2 or later

The configuration assume you have PPL in the directory /usr/local/lib/ppl.
If this is not the case, please change the relevant lines in config.sbt.

To build Jandom, you need first to build a special version of Scalala provided
in this buindle: go into the Scalala directory, and execute: "sbt publish-local".
Then, in the main directoy, do "sbt eclipse" to generate an Eclipse project.
