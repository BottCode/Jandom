This is Jandom, an abstract interpretation based static analyzer 
written in Scala. To try it, you need:

* sbt (Scala Build Tools) 0.11.3 or later [http://www.scala-sbt.org/]
* PPL 1.1.pre2 or later [http://bugseng.com/products/ppl/download/ftp/snapshots/]
* the latest git snapshot of Scalala [https://github.com/scalala/Scalala/]

The configuration assume you have PPL in the directory /usr/local/lib/ppl.
If this is not the case, please change the relevant lines in config.sbt.

To build Jandom, you first need to build Scalala. Download the latest snapshot,
go into the main directory and execute: "sbt publish-local".

Then, in the main directoy of Jandom, execute "sbt eclipse" to generate an 
Eclipse project. The Eclipse configuration must be modified to include the 
native libraries of PPL (in the future, this settings will be carried on by SBT).
